Group 1: Personal Fitness Planner
Objective: Build a simple fitness planner that helps users manage workout schedules.

Instructions:

Create Classes:
User class with properties for Name, Age, and FitnessGoal.
Workout class with properties like WorkoutName, Difficulty, and Duration.
Generate Workout Plans: Write a method in the User class that creates a weekly workout schedule based on the FitnessGoal.
Track Progress: Add a method to log completed workouts and display progress (e.g., "You completed 3 workouts this week!").
Save Data: Use file handling to save the user's profile and workouts so the data can be loaded later.
Bonus: Let users rate workouts (e.g., "easy" or "hard") and adjust future plans.
